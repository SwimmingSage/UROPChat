            <h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
            <p>In a small town composed of a mainland and three remote islands, there has been a heavy storm, triggering multiple accidents throughout the town.  Your job as an emergency responder is to form detailed plans in transporting the injured to the hospitals as soon as possible.</p>
            <p><span class="red">Prioritize based on patients’ health first</span> and then form plans factoring in transport times and road conditions.</p>
            <p>Discuss plans for the patient groups <strong>one at a time and in the order in which you will transport them.</strong>  There may be patients remaining after your first four transports.  Don’t worry; they will be scheduled to be safely transported by the next emergency responder.</p>
