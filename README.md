This is where the data will be stored when using your own computer to run this

To begin running database type and enter this into terminal

**mongod --dbpath ./data**

In another terminal window you will now want to begin running the application, to do this type and enter the command below in this projects directory

**nodemon**

If that doesn't work then type and enter

**npm run start**
